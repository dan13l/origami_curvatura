# origami_curvatura

The purpouse of this code is to study the curvature of foldings patterns.

It is implemented in JavaScript. It used the rabbit ear libray (https://rabbitear.org/) and Origami simulator (https://origamisimulator.org/). The first one developed around the mathematical characteristics of Origami, while the second simulates the folding of the 3D structure.
